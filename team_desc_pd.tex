\section{Robot Description}

\subsection{Hardware Configuration}

The IASLab@Work robot (Fig.~\ref{fig:robot}) is a KUKA youBot with the following sensor suite:

\begin{itemize}
 \item A frontal Hokuyo laser scanner, to be used for navigation and obstacles avoidance tasks
 \item A Kinect RGB-D sensor: the area viewed by the kinect includes the working area of the arm, in order to perform object manipulation tasks without robot motions
 \item An on-board laptop (other than the internal standard Intel Atom PC) running Linux Ubuntu 12.04, to be used to execute the perception and planning tasks (e.g., navigation and object recognition)
 \item A color USB camera on the 5th joint of the manipulator for accurate object localization
\end{itemize}
 
\subsection{Software Configuration}

The IASLab@Work software infrastructure is based on the ROS Groovy middleware running on Ubuntu 12.04, nevertheless most of the developed software tools are stand-alone, middleware-agnostic: packages are integrated within ROS by means of suitable wrappers.\\
The navigation stack is based on particle filter based localization and mapping algorithms, provided by the ROS AMCL and GMapping packages, the latter implemented by one member of the laboratory RoCoCo. The decision making and planning stacks are based on a finite state machine implemented with the ROS Actionlib and MoveBase packages, while manipulation tasks are performed using the MoveIT! ROS package.
3D environment reconstruction is obtained using an effective and efficient registration method called PWN (Point With Normals) (Sec.~\ref{sec:pwn}). 
PWN takes advantage of the 3D structure in determining the data association between two clouds by considering each point along with the statistics of the local surface and of the measurement noise. A novel formulation has been proposed to address the computation of the alignment that takes advantage of point position and surface normals.\\

Object recognition and localization is obtained using reliable algorithms that exploit both vision features and depth information (Sec.~\ref{sec:object_rec}). This module includes a pipeline of processing blocks (Fig.~\ref{fig:pipeline}): the pipeline includes processing blocks for sub-sampling, clustering, noise reduction, and 2D and 3D features detection and descriptors. The model matching step is performed associating the extracted features with features pre-computed from a rigid template (e.g., the CAD model) of the object, sample consensus methods is used to reduce outliers. The result is a set of object candidates, that is refined using an iterative optimization strategy.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[angle=0,width=\linewidth]{images/pipeline.png}
\end{center}
\caption{The IASLab@Work object recognition and localization pipeline.}\label{fig:pipeline}
\end{figure*}

Both the mapping and the object recognition modules have been internally implemented by the team members.
Moreover, the IASLab@Work software includes a semantic mapping system in order to obtain a rich and meaningful representation of the environment (see Sec.~\ref{sec:semantic_map}).\\

Currently, the IASLab@Work robot is able to:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Localize itself and safely navigate toward a selected target area
 \item Build detailed 3D maps of the surrounding environment
 \item Detect QR code-like markers using vision (using the datamatrix\_finder ROS package, modified by the IASLab@Work team members)
 \item Recognize and localize objects using RGB-D sensors, using the techniques proposed in \cite{antonelloVISIGRAPP2014} and \cite{prettoCASE2013}
 \item Perform simple visual servoing and manipulation tasks (e.g., pick and place task, ``cutting a string'' task, \dots)
 \item Capture and understand simple audio signals from the environment
\end{itemize}

 
\section{Research areas and Contributions}\label{sec:research}

Several research areas are involved in the IASLab@Work team development, and some novel contributions have been proposed. Among others, PWN (Sec.~\ref{sec:pwn}), a semantic mapping and learning system (Sec.~\ref{sec:semantic_map}) and a flexible 3D localization system for industrial bin-picking (Sec.~\ref{sec:object_rec}).

\subsubsection{Point Cloud Registration}\label{sec:pwn}

\begin{figure}[t!]

\caption{A 3D scene reconstructed from 3D scans. Top: initial guess. Middle: reconstruction with PWN, done in about 2.16s. Bottom: reconstruction with Generalized ICP, done in about 13.35s. The corridor looks shortened due to a missing frame that caused GICP to fail.}\label{fig:pwn}
\end{figure}

3D models of objects and environments are of utmost importance for a wide range of robotic applications such as navigation, object recognition, manipulation and many others. Hence, being able to acquire these models with the on-board sensors is a necessary precondition for a truly autonomous mobile robot. 3D data can be represented in different ways, one of them is using point clouds. In the past years many point cloud registration algorithms were developed, these algorithms are procedures used to compute the translation and rotation that maximize the overlap between two point clouds. Point cloud registration is a fundamental building block for a lot of robotics applications like odometry reconstruction, SLAM, navigation and 3D object scanning. During his M.Sc. thesis, Jacopo Serafin developed a new point cloud registration approach (Fig.~\ref{fig:pwn}). He proposed a novel formulation to address the computation of the alignment that takes advantage of point position and surface normals. Additionally, he presented a fast method to merge registered point clouds while refining the point positions and reducing the number of points. This new approach has been named Point With Normal aligner (PWN in short).   

\subsubsection{Semantic Mapping and Learning}\label{sec:semantic_map}
In order to properly act in a complex way and execute difficult tasks, robotics systems need a deep knowledge of the environments and the objects in it. Knowledge representation in robotics, however, is a challenging problem, since not only the chosen abstraction may affect the performance of the robot, but also different kinds of knowledge, depending on the context, may be needed in order to implement complex behaviors. In the case of robots that operate in a physical environment, it is required to “close the loop” with perception, thus defining the relationship between numeric and symbolic representation. During his Master Thesis, Roberto Capobianco worked on a system that incrementally builds a rich representation of the environment, exploiting human-robot interaction in order to perform a collaborative lifelong learning task and to solve ambiguities and possible conflicts in the acquired knowledge \cite{bastianelli2013line}\cite{bastianelliBCGIN13}. Such an interactive approach will be extended to different learning tasks in order to improve the current capabilities of the robots.

\subsubsection{Object Recognition and Localization}\label{sec:object_rec}
A reliable and accurate object recognition system is an essential prerequisite to successfully compete in the RoCKIn competitions. The IASLab@Work team members presented a robust and flexible vision system for 3D localization of objects for industrial robots \cite{prettoCASE2013} (Fig.~\ref{fig:obj_rec}). This system can estimate the 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) pose of planar objects from a single 2D image.
The localization software is based on a two step strategy: i) a candidates selection step based on a well-engineered voting scheme ii) a refinement and best match selection step based on a robust iterative optimize-and-score procedure. During this second step, a novel strategy called search-in-the-stack has employed, that avoids the optimization from
being stuck on local minima (representing false positives) created when objects are almost regularly stacked.

\subsubsection{Obstacles Avoidance and Manipulation}\label{sec:manipulation}
In order to obtain a reliable robot navigation, IASLab@Work team members implemented an efficient obstacles avoidance system for mobile robots equipped with range finder sensors, based on the online computation of local artificial potential fields. \newline In the field of manipulation, an effective framework for handling tasks priority of redundant manipulators has been studied and developed.

\includegraphics[angle=0,width=\linewidth]{images/result_number01_small.jpg}

\caption{Final results of the proposed localization system.}\label{fig:obj_rec}
\end{figure}

\section{Reusability and Relevance to Industrial Robotics}

\begin{itemize}
 \item PWN (Sec.~\ref{sec:pwn}) became a basic block for a novel traversability analysis algorithm described by Bogoslavskyi et al. in~\cite{bogoslavskyi-ECMR-13}.
 \item The proposed object recognition and localization systems (Sec.~\ref{sec:object_rec}) is currently installed in seven real world industrial plants \footnote{E.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqhuEjnDdfI}, with different setups, working with hundreds of different models and successfully guiding the manipulators to pick several hundreds of thousands of pieces per year. 
 \item The proposed task priority manager (Sec.~\ref{sec:manipulation}) is currently implemented inside a real 3D industrial simulator for the off-line programming of workcells and machines with several axis.  \footnote{http://www.it-robotics.it/products/3d-simulation/workcellsimulator/?lang=en}
